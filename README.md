# Business Problem: E-Commerce Fraud Detection & Prevention
# Executive Summary
Our e-commerce payment platform is experiencing significant financial losses due to fraudulent transactions. We need to understand fraud patterns, identify high-risk segments, and develop actionable insights to reduce fraud rates while maintaining a seamless customer experience.

# Business Context

* Industry: Digital Payments & E-Commerce
* Stakeholders: Risk Management Team, Payment Operations, Customer Success, Executive Leadership
* Current Challenge: Rising fraud rates impacting revenue and customer trust

# Key Business Questions
### 1. Fraud Prevalence & Financial Impact

* What is the current fraud rate across our platform?
* What is the total financial exposure from fraudulent transactions?
* How does fraud vary by transaction amount ranges?

### 2. Risk Segmentation

* Which merchant categories are most vulnerable to fraud?
* Which countries present the highest fraud risk?
* What transaction types carry the greatest fraud exposure?

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

* Are there specific times of day when fraud peaks?
* How do device and IP risk scores correlate with actual fraud?
* What transaction amount patterns distinguish fraud from legitimate activity?

### 4. Operational Priorities

* Which customer segments require enhanced monitoring?
* What thresholds should trigger automatic fraud reviews?
* How can we optimize fraud prevention without increasing false positives?

# Success Metrics

* Reduce fraud rate from current baseline by 30% within 6 months
* Minimize false positives to maintain customer satisfaction (target: <2%)
* Improve detection speed to catch fraud within 24 hours
* Quantify savings from prevented fraudulent transactions

# Deliverables

1. Comprehensive EDA with statistical insights [link].
2. SQL-based analytical queries for ongoing monitoring [link].
3. Interactive Tableau dashboard for real-time fraud surveillance [link].
4. Actionable recommendations for fraud prevention strategies [link].

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The companies main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: table1, table2, table3, table4, with a total row count of X records. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Table 2:**
- **Table 3:**
- **Table 4:**
- **Table 5:**
